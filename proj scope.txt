we are building A soft, immersive SAPPHIC spa world where you learn linear algebra ‚Üí tensor analysis ‚Üí tensor calculus.

Gentle, non-intimidating visualizations and text instead of scary math jargon.

üìö Educational Content Scope (MVP)

Phase 1: Linear Algebra (Core Basics)
(Get people soaked in vectors and matrices before tensors)

    Scalars (quick intro)

    Vectors (components, addition, scaling)

    Dot Product (and angle intuition)

    Matrices (as linear maps)

    Matrix multiplication (visually)

    Eigenvectors + Eigenvalues (soft intro, optional in MVP)

Phase 2: Tensors (Lite Touch for MVP)

    What is a tensor (beyond matrices)

    Basic operations: reshaping, contracting

    Tensor ranks (basic intuition)

    Very gentle visualization of how tensors transform spaces

üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Educational Content (Phase 3)
Major Area	Concepts Introduced
Tensor Fields	Understanding tensors assigned to each point of a space
Covariant Derivative	How vectors and tensors change when you "move" through space
Metric Tensor   how distances and angles are measured
Christoffel Symbols	The "massage therapists" of spacetime: connections that tell you how things bend
Geodesics	Path of maximum relaxation: curves that feel "straight" in a curved space
Pullback / Pushforward	How functions "pull" or "push" tensor fields across spaces

üé® Visual / Interactive Features (Phase 3)

    Tactile field visualization:
    See tensor fields "flow" across surfaces as ripples and stretching textures.

    Drag a particle through space:
    Watch how its attached vector or tensor "twists" based on the connection (Christoffel symbols animate underneath softly like water currents).

    Metric Field Stretch:
    Animate a "spa towel" (grid) being stretched and compressed differently at different points in space.

    Smooth Geodesic Path Drawer:
    Let the user touch two points, and the app animates the "straightest" path between them under the current metric.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack (Phase 3)
Category	Tech
Visuals	Likely WebGL (using three.js or regl.js) OR Canvas 2D (lite version first)
Math Engine	Expand math utilities ‚Äî symbolic derivations, automatic Christoffel computation
State Management	zustand (fine), possibly bring in recoil or something heavier if needed for complex scene graph
Motion Library	Framer Motion (for soft transitions), possibly GSAP (GreenSock) if crazy animations needed
Future Expand	Possibly integrate with Rust (WebAssembly) backend later if simulations get heavy

üå∏ Phase 3 Feel

Imagine this:

    You trace your finger across a softly glowing manifold.

    A little trail of gold-thread vectors spin and dance as you pass.

    Space itself ripples under your touch.

    Christoffel flows weave under your path like underwater currents.

    You are learning the deep mechanics of curved spacetime
    without ever being scared, without ever feeling lost‚Äî
    because it feels like soaking deeper into a warm mathematical ocean.

üß© Page Layouts (Phase 3)
Page	Purpose
Tensor Fields	Introduce moving fields ‚Äî live, tactile
Connections and Derivatives	Play with Christoffel animations
Metric Towel	Stretch grids and observe distance distortion
Geodesics Spa	Find paths of least effort
Pushforward/Pullback Dance	Pull objects through spaces and feel transformations




we build reusable componets for the concepts 
we have each visualization as a component 
we will havea math component that will be used in each page 
we have a page for each topic 
ALL styles are speerate from main code 
we have all buttons as thier individual components
we have a intro component it will be used in each page / topic 
EVERYTHING IS TO BE IN SECTIONS FULL MODULAR CODEBASE 


each section will cover all the math related to the subject
there will be hundreds of visualizations and hundreds of formula and solutions
